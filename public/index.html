            <h3>Book Recommender System</h3>
            <p>Built in C++, the Book Recommender System showcases object-oriented principles, advanced algorithms, and optimized data structures to deliver tailored book recommendations. Drawing data from files, the system parses and manages a list of users, books, and their respective ratings. Emphasizing efficiency and data integrity, unique book entries are maintained using sets, while maps expedite rapid data lookups. Use of vectors of object pointer insure a many to many (book and user) relationship can be maintain in a no duplicative manner.  A dot-plot inspired algorithm identifies users with congruent reading tastes, serving suggestions of unread books that align with their preferences. Exception handling ensures robustness, gracefully addressing potential discrepancies like invalid ratings.

        <p>In my second summer at Arc-Two Consulting, I took on a leadership role in various development tasks for project Arctek. I contributed to the software development of a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) tool tailored for the utility industry’s asset accounting needs. I led multiple full-stack projects, managing the entire software design lifecycle and implementing production-ready features. My work included designing scalable Oracle SQL database models with a focus on normalization and contributing to the deployment of security, cloud scalability, and big data solutions.</p>

        <h3>Internship at Arc-Two Consulting, Inc.</h3>
        <p>May 2023 - Aug 2023 · 4 mos</p>
        <p>Marietta, Georgia, United States · On-site</p>
        <p>At Arc-Two, I've had the experience of learning hands-on the inner workings of the utility industry, delving deep into asset accounting, financial systems, and customer relationship management software. I have also had the unique opportunity to spearhead my own project, where I designed SQL database structures and implemented PL/SQL logic, data integration, and methods for customer visualization. However, I've learned the most from the journey of managing a project, from defining the requirements and conceptualizing ideas to its implementation. This has allowed me to lead in brainstorming at meetings and working with senior members.</p>
